# Cloud Native System Monitoring

This repository contains a Python-based Monitoring Application developed using Flask and psutil. Additionally, it covers the steps to run the Python app locally, containerize it with Docker, push it to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and create an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster with Kubernetes Deployments and Services using Python scripts.
